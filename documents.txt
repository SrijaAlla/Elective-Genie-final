CSE 540LEC - Machine Learning and Society
Machine Learning (ML) systems make decisions in all parts of our lives, starting from the mundane (e.g. Netflix recommending us movies/TV shows), to the somewhat more relevant (e.g. algorithms deciding which ads Google shows you) to the downright worrisome (e.g. algorithms deciding the risk of a person who is arrested committing a crime in the future). Whether we like it or not, ML systems are here to stay: the economic benefit of automation provided by ML systems means companies and even governments will continue to use algorithms to make decisions that shape our lives. While the benefits of using algorithms to make such decisions can be obvious, these algorithms sometimes have unintended/unforeseen harmful effects. This class will look into various ML systems in use in real life and go into depth of both the societal as well as technical issues. For students who are more technologically inclined, this course will open their eyes to societal implications of technology that such students might create in the future (and at the very least see why claiming ¿But algorithms/math cannot be biased¿ is at best a cop-out). For students who are more interested in the societal implications of algorithms, this class will give them a better understanding of the technical/mathematical underpinnings of these algorithms (because if you do not understand, at some non-trivial level, how these algorithms work you cannot accurately judge the societal impacts of an algorithm).

Error correcting codes (or just codes) are systematic ways of introducing redundancy into data so that the original information can be recovered even when the data is corrupted.

This course will discuss the theoretical aspects of codes and will focus mostly on the worst-case noise model pioneered by Hamming. However, we will discuss quite a few results on the stochastic noise model pioneered by Shannon. The course will roughly cover three parts: (i) combinatorial aspects of codes, i.e. the limit of what can and cannot be achieved with codes; (ii) computationally efficient algorithms for using codes; and (ii) application of codes in theoretical computer science. Major developments in coding theory since the 1990s will be emphasized. This course is dual listed with CSE 445.

CSE 662LEC - Languages and Runtimes for Big Data
Addressing the challenges of big data requires a combination of human intuition and automation. Rather than tackling these challenges head-on with build-from-scratch solutions, or through general-purpose database systems, developer and analyst communities are turning to building blocks: Specialized languages, runtimes, data-structures, services, compilers, and frameworks that simplify the task of creating a system that is efficient enough to handle terabytes of data or more, while still being manageable enough to adapt to changing settings. This project-based course explores data management building-blocks in both Database and Programming Language literature, and teaches students to identify and implement new data management tools and techniques by drawing from both areas.
